export const descriptionData = `Hey there, I'm Himanshu Singh, a dedicated Full Stack Developer with a flair for JavaScript, React, Redux, NodeJs, and SQL. With a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from NIET Greater Noida, I'm all about crafting solutions that make a difference.

Problem-solving is my jam. There's nothing quite like the rush of cracking a tough nut and finding the perfect solution.

Currently, I'm immersed in building a groundbreaking application that aims to revolutionize the way businesses connect with their customers. Picture this: a platform where businesses can list their stores and seamlessly transform our client app into their very own e-commerce powerhouse. Users can browse, order, book appointments, or dive into an educational adventure â€“ all within one app. It's a game-changer, and I'm thrilled to be a part of it.

Outside of coding, you'll find me kicking a football around, hitting the gym, or diving into a gaming session. I believe in the mantra of 'work hard, party hard.'

If you're looking for someone to bring innovation and dedication to your team, or if you just want to chat about exciting opportunities, hit me up! Let's create something amazing together.`;
